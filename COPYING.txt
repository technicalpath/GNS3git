GNS3 trademark
--------------

  "GNS3" is a trademark of GNS3 Technologies, Inc.

Windows Driver Kit
------------------

  The Windows binary distribution includes devcon.exe, a Microsoft(R)
  Windows Driver Kit (WDK) sample in object code form which is
  redistributed under the terms of the WDK License terms.

  With respect to binaries built using the Microsoft(R) Windows
  Driver Kit (WDK), GPLv3 does not extend to any WDK Distributable Code.

OpenSSL License
---------------

  The OpenSSL toolkit stays under a dual license, i.e. both the conditions of
  the OpenSSL License and the original SSLeay license apply to the toolkit.
  See below for the actual license texts. Actually both licenses are BSD-style
  Open Source licenses. In case of any license issues related to OpenSSL
  please contact openssl-core@openssl.org.
